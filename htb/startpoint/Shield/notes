port 80 just looks like a default iis server page

looks like there is a wordpress directory -> will need to gobuster this, also run wp-scan on it

going through the entire list we dont see many things that are exploitable

take a look at the walkthrough, you are supposed to use the password from the postgres user, which doesnt make sense, but ya know
admin:P@s5w0rd!
