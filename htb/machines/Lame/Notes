21 - FTP:
- vsftpd 2.3.4, which has a possible vulnerability
  - Cant seem to exploit this

22 - SSH:
- OpenSSH 4.7p1, doesnt seem vulnerable

139/tcp - netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X
445/tcp - netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X

Looking at SMB enumeration - https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/12/02/pwk-notes-smb-enumeration-checklist-update1.html
- nmblookup, can be installed with sudo apt install samba-common-bin
- smbmap
- need to checkout enum4linux

What I learned:
- When you find a new protocol, learn all of it, also learn all of the enumeration tools for it
- If you encounter an error, look them up, I ran into an older version of SMB and my client kept throwing an error because of it
- your order of attack should be to enumerate, look for vulns, keep enumerating, if there are potential vulns then try to go with that
- Go with the easiest path and then work up to the ones that will take longer
- when testing exploits, look for the most powerful one, i.e. the rce vulns, and then walk down if you dont have any other leads

- Need to learn more about SMB enumeration
- Also need to learn how to sort through whats useless vs useful <- this prob just comes with time
