Ubuntu download:
`snap install john-the-ripper`

using something like zip2john to extract hash from zip file:
`john-the-ripper.zip2john`

You should pipe this into some sortve hash file, so append ` > zip.hashes` to it

Next you can go ahead and get to just brute force it by using the below command, show is just to show the password found

`john-the-ripper zip.hashes --show`



ToDo:
Should look more into how JTR extracts the "non-hash" and uses that for future use
