## - Learn more about External Recon
    - Want to focus on OSCP boxes, not sure how effective this will be now
    - Stuff is still super useful

- SSH can do a graphical connection with '-X'
    - can also be done with '-Y -C', it's less secure but faster
- 0.0.0.0 means all IP addresses 

## SSH Tunneling & Port Forwarding
- can port forward a service that is only accessable on the internal network, so you can hit it with scans
- e.x. internal dB, you can port forward 3306 and hit it with mysql scans
- ex. try to port forward the internal dB on HTB oopsie
- 'ssh -R 0.0.0.0:3306:127.0.0.1:3306 username@ip'
- good way to exporse firewalled off ports
- look at doing a port 2 port, I think you send traffic from one port to another
- There are tricker/cooler ways to tunnel data/traffic, they don't appy to the OSCP at the moment, should come back to this later

## Brute Forcing - They have a good cheat sheet => skip for now since it might not be as required for OSCP

# Linux Stuff
- "bin/sh" is actually a symbolic link to currently configured shell
- default shell is dash, not bash, it has less functionality but is a bit faster
- not all reverse shells work, need to try some that have already been battled tested and are more popular than a custom one
- "2>/dev/null" 2 is the error file descriptor; > redirect output to a file; /dev/null is a file that ignores data


## Linux Priv Esc
- Download the priv esc cheat sheet and run through it to you learn it => https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist
- Get the OS version and search for possible kernel exploits
- "||" logical or, if the first command returns false then it will execute the second one, logical or chain im guessing
- look in env variables to see if there is anything interesting in them "(env || set) 2>/dev/null"
- There is a good list of tools for kernal level exploitation [list and try tools]
- look at sudo version to see if it is vulnerable
- understand and lookup guides for sysetm enumeration [todo]
- Lookup version #s of built in executables and defenses for both windows and linux
    - linux: AppArmor, Grsecurity, Pax, ExecShield, SElinux, ALSR
- take a look for mounted vs unmounted drives, try to mount unmounted drives
- look at a list of software installed to look for possible vulnerablities, prob want to just let linpeas take care of this one
