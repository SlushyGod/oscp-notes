To edit your hosts file `nano /etc/hosts`

When looking at websites for anything interesting, try to touch everything, go to each folder and see if there is possibly anything
Also make sure to read the text, sometimes there are hints in there
For websites, if there is a new directory then you should check it, prob wouldnt hurt to enumerate it as well

Make sure and be careful to read everything and take everything in
Try not to miss important enumeration pieces


Things I need to learn:
how does virtual hosting work?

Add directory to path:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

DONT use tools that you haven't already tested out, you want want to garuntee you cant access the service vs your tool being broken

Sometimes it helps to re-do things that you prev did, maybe you missed something, or something changed

when testing something, make sure that you put it in a state that you are sure it is in, repition to make sure it is in that state always helps

if a custom tool doesnt seem to work, reference other tools to see what you are doing wrong

try different ports for reverse shells, like common ports, sometimes firewalls only open certain ports

IF CUSTOM TOOLS DONT WORK, TRY TOOLS THAT ARE KNOWN TO WORK

When you get creds, use them on EVERYTHING

Always TRY EVERYTHING even if you think its a bit farfetched, just as long as you are stuck

mysql cli cheat sheet -> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-mysql

need to learm about linux groups, should know everything about the user that you are logged in as, what is ID, GID, GROUPS, Etc.

make sure to understand your tools, also unless you read everything, dont assume something has been checked

Cool way to get a file downloaded on machine that can't connect to outside is to setup an HTTP server and curl the file from that

Run the tools often enough where you gain confidence in your tools and techniques, so that when something doesn't work, you know it's not you and your tools, its just that something is preventing it from working
