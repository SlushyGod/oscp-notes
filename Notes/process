1. Kick of nmap scans
    - First do a normal scan with default scripts and specify output `nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/[box name] [ip address]` which does the first 1000 ports
    - After that is done you can kick off scans for all ports to see if there are any other services

2. Use data from ports to do a general lookup of potential vulnerabilities

3. Attack by order of easiest path


ALWAYS KEEP ENUMERATING AND MOVING
